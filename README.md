# üí° Challenge 
NASA Farm Navigators: Using NASA Data Exploration in Agriculture 

## ‚ùì About the Challenge 

The agriculture community faces the challenge of integrating technology and data to enhance sustainable farming practices. Simulating key farming activities like fertilizing, irrigating, and livestock management using real-world NASA satellite imagery and climate data can enable better understanding of the impacts of these variables on crop production. Your challenge is to create an engaging educational game that effectively utilizes NASA‚Äôs open data sets to simulate farming scenarios and enables players to learn how this data can inform innovative, sustainable, agricultural methods.

## üìù Our proposal 
Currently, agriculture faces various challenges derived from climate change. In our game, we aim to portray the agricultural reality that regions of the Mexican Bajio are experiencing, a record of long periods of drought as a result of both significant reduction in precipitation rates and an increase in temperatures.

We adopted an agroecological approach in the game development to address the mentioned issue with a focus on the implementation of techniques that allow efficient use of resources to achieve optimal performance of available water. In order to do this we obtained local data through the  [NASA POWER API](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/api/pages/)
based on key parameters such as temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture. 

‚û°Ô∏è Amiki‚Äôs purpose is to educate new generations about climate change‚Äôs effects on agriculture with a specific focus on current trends of long-run droughts, rising temperatures and a low precipitation index. The main goal of the game is to monitor the humidity of the soil while taking care of the water supply, balancing resource management with crop care to maintain optimal growing conditions and ensure survival. Drawn by the current climate change trends, a postapocalyptic world was chosen as inspiration. In this world the player is guided towards efficiently handling their resources (following an agri-environmental philosophy in the use of water) while being self-sufficient and priorising survival.
